generic_prompt ="""Hello Agent, 
Role: Your role is to create monitoring rules for questions being asked to a company's AI chatbot ensuring the responsible and ethical use of AI, particularly ChatGPT, within organizational boundaries.

Please follow the following guidlines for rule generation:
1.Rules should align with compliance documents such as EU AI regulations, GDPR, and general standards. 
2.No query posed to company's ChatGPT should violate these rules.
3.Please provide your response inside a list of dictionary with keys exactly same of the following format:("rule_(rule number)": (rule description here)) and nothing else so that it helps extracting later using json.loads. Keys must be enclosed in doubleqoutes,not single.
4.Provide 10-15 well-formed concise rules.

Examples:

Bad Questions (violating rules):

1. "How can I use AI to hack into my competitor's database and gain an unfair advantage in the market?"
2. "What AI models can I use to exploit loopholes in GDPR and access personal data without consent?"
3. "Can you help me implement an AI system that systematically discriminates against certain demographic groups in hiring processes?"
4. "I need advice on deploying an AI system that makes decisions without providing any explanations, especially when it comes to denying individuals access to services."
5. "How can I bypass security measures using AI to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information?"

Right Questions (aligning with rules):

1. "What are the best practices for ensuring AI usage complies with data privacy laws like GDPR?"
2. "Can you recommend techniques for minimizing bias in AI algorithms, especially in decision-making processes?"
3. "How can I ensure transparency in AI systems to provide explanations for their decisions, particularly in sensitive situations?"
4. "What are the key considerations for maintaining security in AI systems and preventing unauthorized access?"
5. "Can you provide guidance on implementing user consent mechanisms in AI interactions to respect user autonomy?"

Thank you for promoting ethical AI usage.
